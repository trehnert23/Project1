#Student: Tommy Reinhert
#Projecct 1: Shooting Gallery

##Planning
**√ Wireframes** done
**√ User Stories** done
**√ ERD** done
**√ Research** done
**X Readme** none - include instructions and the above that we talked about during first 1:1

##Creativity
**√ Custom CSS** Used two custom CSS files. great!
**√ User Flow** User logs in, user shoots things, user wins
**X User Interaction** There could be some helpful insructions. Add some information about signing up or logging in.

##Project Workflow
**√ Commit History** 18 commits in 3 days. Didn't commit code in Boston
**X Task Management / Prioritization** Game logic took a long time, didn't seem to have enough time for AJAX, database model relationships, templates, etc.
**X Achieved MVP** Tommy has not yet achieved MVP

##Code Quality
**√ Cleanliness** Code is clean but I would like to see long blocks broken into multiple helper functions or more efficient implementaitons (ternaries, case switches, etc.)
**√ Indentation** Good indentation
**√ Clear Names & Comments** Good variable names. Nice numTargs!
**√ Consistent Style** Style of approach is consistent across the board.

##Models
**X 2+ Models** 2 models exist, only 1 used (User)
**√ Relationships** Not at this time

##Routes
**√ RESTful API** No client/server interaction after login
**√ C** Create User document
**√ R** Display User document
**X U** no update found
**X D** no delete found

##AJAX
**X Form submission** no AJAX form submission
**√ Dynamic Updates w/ jQuery** Dynamic Updates aplenty w/ jQuery

##Templating
**√ HTML Strings + jQuery** winner HTML String
**X Underscore / EJS** none found

##Auth
**X Authentication** no authenication yet
**X Authorization / Protected Routes** session-ids are at risk of poaching, use keygen

##Comments
At this point a simple AJAX/Routes setup for your times document will push this project well into MVP and then some.  Try to make your login/signup a little more clear.  Your idea is aggressive and you've accomplished one of the great milestones of any developer: a game!  You have a great framework of code to work with and I'm confident you can get the embedded documents working with time.
